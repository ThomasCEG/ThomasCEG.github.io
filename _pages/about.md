In the calendar year 2024 I will additionally be a visiting professor at the Department of Quantitative Economics at Maastricht University, School of Business and Economics. I work on theoretical and applied econometrics related to climate change and energy. My main research areas are time series econometrics (non-causal econometrics) and machine learning. I organised the [Dauphine Econometrics seminar](https://leda.dauphine.fr/fr/seminaire-externe/seminaires-thematiques.html).
